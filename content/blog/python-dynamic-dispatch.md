🦝 Hey want tO see a nEat PYtHoN triCK?

```python
def f(name: str):
    print("hiya {}".format(name))

🐮 Are you ok? You're yelling a lot about Python again--

```python
# shut up

def test_patrick(context: TestContext):
    # do thing

def test_crabs(context: TestContext):
    # do other thing

context = TestContext()
tests = []
for t in locals():
    if t.startswith("test_"):
        tests.append(t)
for test in tests:
    test(context)
```

🐮 Oh so you could...

🦝 ...

🐮 Are you going to interrupt me?

🦝 Not yet.

🐮 Ok... you could search your scope and find a bunch of functions with a name and common interface--

🦝 AND CALL THEM! DYNAMIC DISPATCH!!

🐮 That's nice.

🦝 YEAH IT IS COOL!
